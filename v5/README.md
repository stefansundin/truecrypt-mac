# v5

**Important: You have to [install osxfuse](https://osxfuse.github.io/) first.** If you use Homebrew then you can run `brew cask install osxfuse`.

If you have trouble installing, then please see [this issue](https://github.com/stefansundin/truecrypt-mac/issues/3) for more detailed instructions.

**Note:** This should work for macOS 10.9 and up, but the lowest that I have tested is 10.13.

**Note: This has not been tested extensively yet. Please consider this experimental! Please open an issue if you encounter a problem!**

### Changelog

- Add more compilation flags to wxWidgets to avoid linking to unneeded libraries. See https://github.com/stefansundin/truecrypt-mac/issues/1.
